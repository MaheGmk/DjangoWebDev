# Sentiment Analysis Website

I have developed a website using Django to calculate positive and negative scores, essentially performing sentiment analysis on a blog. This project leverages both front-end and back-end development tools to create a seamless user experience for analyzing the sentiment of textual content.

## Features

- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyze blog posts and comments to determine their positive and negative sentiment scores.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Intuitive design with easy navigation and interaction for users to input their text and get results quickly.
- **Real-time Processing**: Instant feedback on the sentiment of the text provided.

## Tech Stack

### Front-End
- **HTML5**: For structuring the web content.
- **CSS3**: For styling the web pages.
- **Bootstrap**: For responsive design and improved user experience.

### Back-End
- **Django**: The primary framework used for developing the web application.
- **Python**: The programming language used for backend logic and sentiment analysis algorithms.
- **SQLite**: Database management for storing user data and analysis results (can be replaced with other databases like PostgreSQL).

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: Users can input text into a designated area on the website.
2. **Processing**: The input text is processed by the backend Django application.
3. **Sentiment Analysis**: The backend performs sentiment analysis using predefined algorithms to calculate the positive and negative scores.
4. **Output**: The results are displayed to the user, showing the sentiment analysis in a clear and concise manner.


## Future Improvements

- **Enhanced Sentiment Analysis**: Incorporate more advanced natural language processing techniques.
- **User Authentication**: Allow users to create accounts and save their analysis history.
- **Visualization**: Add graphical representations of sentiment analysis results.
